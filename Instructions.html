<h1>Installation:</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;" >The program includes two Jar files, Generate_Result.jar and Register_Time.jar. </p>
<h1>How to use the program:</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To generate a result file, you will need to use the Generate_Result.jar. The program takes three files. Two of the files (the ones containing the start and finish times) can be created using the Register_Time.jar. The third one should contain information about the participants.  
    Register_Time.jar automatically saves the output in a plain text file. When you wish to record a time, simply register the users' numberplate in the textfield and click "Register". The user and their time will be automatically recorded in a file called "Registration". Click the red button in the upper left corner to exit the program. </p>
